# Blob

This logo was inspired by [@Primer](https://www.youtube.com/c/PrimerLearning)'s [blob plushie](https://store.dftba.com/collections/primer/products/primer-blob-plushie)


Problems found:

On Ubuntu 22.04 youtube links which are videos in a playlist cause problems when passed to blob-dl without quotation (this is an Ubuntu problem, not blob-dl")

### Things to explain in the wiki
Best available format actually merges the best video and audio formats, so it doesn't show up as a format in the list

Recommended dependencies: ffmpeg, ffprobe

Needed for: merging the best video-audio files && post-processing
